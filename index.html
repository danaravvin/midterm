		<h1>Basset Hound</h1>
		<h4>From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia</h4>
		<p>The <b>Basset Hound</b> is a short-legged breed of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" target="_blank">dog</a> of the hound family. The Basset is a scent hound that was originally bred for the purpose of hunting hare. Their sense of smell and ability to ground-scent is second only to that of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bloodhound" target="_blank">Bloodhound</a>.<sup>[1]</sup> Basset Hounds are one of 6 recognised basset-type breeds in <i>France</i>. The name Basset is derived from the <i>French</i> word bas, meaning "low", with the attenuating suffix -et, together meaning "rather low". Basset Hounds are usually <u>bicolours</u> or <u>tricolours</u> of standard hound colouration.</p>

				Bassets are large, short, solid and long, with curved sabre <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tail" target="_blank">tails</a> held high over their long backs. An adult dog weighs between 20 and 35 kilograms (44 and 77 lb). This breed, relative to its size, is heavier-boned than any other.<sup>[2]</sup>
				<br><br>This breed, like its ancestor the Bloodhound, has a hanging <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Skin" target="_blank">skin</a> structure, which causes the face to occasionally look sad; this, for many people, adds to the breed's charm. The dewlap, seen as the loose, elastic skin around the neck, and the trailing ears which along with the Bloodhound are the longest of any breed, help trap the scent of what they are tracking. Its neck is wider than its head. This, combined with the loose skin around its face and neck means that flat collars can easily be pulled off. The previous FCI standard described the characteristic skin of the Basset, which resembles its ancestor the Bloodhound as "loose". This wording has since been updated to "supple and elastic". The looseness of the skin results in the Basset's characteristic facial wrinkles. They drool a lot due to their loose <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Flews" target="_blank">flews</a>.
				<br><br>The Basset's short legs are due to a form of dwarfism. Their short stature can be deceiving; Bassets are surprisingly long and can reach things on table tops that other dogs of similar heights cannot. Because Bassets are so heavy and have such short legs, they are not able to hold themselves above water for very long when swimming, and should always be closely supervised in the water.

				The short-haired coat of a Basset is long, smooth and soft, and sheds constantly. Any hound coloration is acceptable, but this varies from country to country. They are usually Black, Tan and White tricolors or Tan and White bicolors. Tan can vary from reddish-brown and Red to Lemon. Lemon and White is less common color. Some Bassets are also classified as gray or blue - this colour is considered rare and undesirable. 
				<br><br>The source of colour is the E Locus (MC1R), which has four alleles: EM, EG, E, and e. The EM, E and e alleles are present in the Basset Hounds. The E allele allows for the production of both red and black pigments, so is present with the majority of colour patterns in Basset Hounds. 
				<br><br>Red and Lemon colours are caused by the e allele of MC1R. The e allele is recessive, so red and lemon dogs are homozygous e/e. Lemon dogs are lighter in colour than Reds, but the genetic mechanism that dilutes phaeomelanin in this instance is unknown. No black hairs will be present on either Red or Lemon dogs. If there are any black hairs, the dog is officially a tricolour.
				<br><br>The EM allele produces a black mask on the face that may extend up around the eyes and onto the ears. This pattern is most easily seen on Mahogany dogs, although any Basset colour pattern may express the EM allele, except for "red and white" or "lemon and white" due to e/e.<sup>[4]</sup>
				<br><br>Many Bassets have a clearly defined white <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Horse_markings#Facial_markings" target="_blank">blaze</a> and a white tip to their tail, intended to aid hunters in finding their dogs when tracking through underbrush. Like all dogs, the Basset Hound's coat is naturally oily. The oil in their coat has a distinctive "hound scent", which is natural to the breed.<sup>[5]</sup><br>

				The Basset Hound is a friendly, outgoing, and playful dog, tolerant of children and other pets.<sup>[3]</sup> They are: 
				<ul>
					<li>Extremely vocal</li>

				Prospective owners must be prepared to handle bassets firmly and patiently.

				The modern Basset Hound descends from French dogs that were bred in Great Britain in the late 1800s.
				<br><br>The earliest-known depictions of short-legged hunting dogs are engravings from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Middle_Kingdom_of_Egypt" target="_blank">Middle Kingdom of Egypt</a>.<sup>[20]</sup> Mummified remains of short-legged dogs from that period have been uncovered in the Dog Catacombs of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saqqara" target="_blank">Saqqara, Egypt</a>.<sup>[21]</sup> Scent Hounds were used for hunting in both Ancient Greece and Ancient Rome.

		<h2><a class="none" name="St">St. Hubert's Hound</a></h2>

				The basset type originated in France, and is descended from the 6th century hounds belonging to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St_Hubert" target="_blank">St Hubert of Belgium</a>, which through breeding at the Benedictine Abbey of St. Hubert eventually became what is known as the St Hubert's Hound around 1000 AD. St Hubert's original hounds are descended from the Laconian (Spartan) Hound,<sup>[22]</sup> one of four groups of dogs discerned from Greek representations and descriptions. These scent hounds were described as large, slow, 'short-legged and deep mouthed' dogs with a small head, straight nose, upright ears and long neck, and either tan with white markings or black with tan markings.<sup>[23]</sup> Laconian Hounds were reputed to not give up the scent until they found their prey. They eventually found their way to Constantinople, and from there to Europe.<sup>[22]</sup>

				The first mention of a "basset" dog appeared in La Venerie, an illustrated hunting text written by Jacques du Fouilloux in 1585.<sup>[24][25]</sup> The dogs in Fouilloux's text were used to hunt foxes and badgers. It is believed that the Basset type originated as a mutation in the litters of Norman Staghounds, a descendant of the St Hubert's Hound. These precursors were most likely bred back to the St. Hubert's Hound, among other derivative French hounds. Until after the French Revolution around the year 1789, hunting from horseback was the preserve of kings, large aristocratic families and of the country squires, and for this reason short-legged dogs were highly valued for hunting on foot.
				<br><br>Basset-type hounds became popular during the reign of Emperor <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Napoleon_III" target="_blank">Napoleon III</a> (r. 1852–1870). In 1853, Emmanuel Fremiet, "the leading sculptor of animals in his day" exhibited bronze sculptures of Emperor Napoleon III's basset hounds at the Paris Salon.<sup>[26]</sup> Ten years later in 1863 at the first exhibition of dogs held in Paris, basset hounds attained international attention.<sup>[27]</sup>
				<br><br>The controlled breeding of the short haired basset began in France in the year 1870. From the existing bassets, Count Le Couteulx of Canteleu fixed a utilitarian type with straight front legs known as the Chien d'Artois, whereas Mr. Louis Lane developed a more spectacular type, with crooked front legs, known as the Basset Normand. These were bred together to create the original <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Basset_Artésien_Normand" target="_blank">Basset Artésien Normand</a>.<sup>[28]</sup>

				French basset hounds were being imported into England at least as early as the 1870s. While some of these dogs were certainly Basset Artésien Normands, by the 1880s <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linebreeding" target="_blank"></a>linebreeding had thrown back to a different heavier type. Everett Millais, who is considered to be the father of the modern Basset Hound, bred one such dog, Nicholas, to a Bloodhound bitch named Inoculation through <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_insemination" target="_blank"></a>artificial insemination in order to create a heavier basset in England in the 1890s. The litter was delivered by caesarean section, and the surviving pups were refined with French and English bassets.<sup>[29]</sup> The first breed standard for what is now known as the Basset Hound was made in Great Britain at the end of 19th century.<sup>[30]</sup> This standard was updated in 2010.<sup>[31]</sup>
